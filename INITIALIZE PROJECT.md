# Step 1: As a technical expert, learn and analyze this codebase then provide a clear project overview:

- Core Components: Describe the Tech Stack or Major components or Modules, their responsibilities and any key classes or functions they contain. Note any relevant design patterns or architectural approaches.

- Component Interactions: Explain how the components interact, including data and control flow, communication methods, and any APIs or interfaces used. Highlight use of dependency injection or service patterns if applicable.

- Deployment Architecture (Optional): Summarize the deployment setup, including build steps, external dependencies, required environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod), and infrastructure or containerization details.

- Runtime Behavior: Describe how the application initializes, handles requests and responses, runs business workflows, and manages errors or background tasks.

- Stay focused on providing a technical overview that helps a developer quickly understand how the system works. Avoid personal opinions or implementation suggestions unless specifically asked.

# Step 2: Lalu hasilnya buat jadi file 'TECHNICAL OVERVIEW.md'

# Step 3: Initialize AGENTS.md (using skill "agents-md-generator") as a README for agents: a dedicated, predictable place to provide the context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your project. use this best practice:

- Use concrete commands:
  Wrap commands in back-ticks so agents can copy-paste without guessing.

- Update alongside code:
  Treat AGENTS.md like code—PR reviewers should nudge updates when build steps change.

- One source of truth:
  Avoid duplicate docs; link to READMEs or design docs instead of pasting them.

- Make requests precise:
  The more precise your guidance for the task at hand, the more likely the agent is to accomplish that task to your liking.

- Verify:
  Require objective proof: tests, lint, type check, and a diff confined to agreed paths.
